# energy-consumption-forecasting
## Overview
Energy consumption forecasting plays a vital role in optimizing power generation, reducing waste, and ensuring energy reliability. Accurate demand prediction enables energy providers to make data-driven decisions and improve efficiency.
## Objective: 
Forecast energy consumption to optimize power generation and minimize waste.
## Data Sources
- Historical energy consumption data.
- Weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- Electricity prices and tariff structures.
- Demand patterns (e.g., industrial, residential, commercial).
## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
- Aggregate historical consumption data from energy management systems.
- Incorporate external factors such as weather conditions, electricity prices, and demand patterns.
### 2.	Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values in consumption or weather data.
- Resolve time-series inconsistencies (e.g., irregular intervals, duplicate timestamps).
### 3.	Feature Engineering
- Create features such as:
    - Time of day and day of the week.
    - Weather conditions like temperature and humidity.
    - Seasonal trends and holiday effects.
 ### 4.	Model Development
- Build predictive models tailored to time-series data:
    - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): For modeling linear trends.
    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): For capturing complex patterns in time-series data.
    - Train models using historical data and validate against recent trends.
 ### 5.	Deployment
 - Integrate forecasting models into energy management systems.
 - Enable real-time updates for energy generation planning.
### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regularly evaluate prediction accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Retrain models with updated data to adapt to changing patterns.
## Tools and Technologies
### Python:
- Libraries like stats models for ARIMA and Tensor Flow for LSTM models.
- pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
### SQL: 
- For querying and managing historical and real-time energy data.
### Power BI: 
- For creating interactive dashboards to visualize forecasts and trends.
